# Notes Taking App

This project is a clone of the popular productivity and note-taking platform, Notion. It's built using React for the front-end and utilizes AWS services for the back-end. Additionally, we've incorporated local storage to provide temporary note storage for users.

## Overview

The Notion Clone project replicates the core functionalities of Notion, allowing users to create, edit, and organize their notes and tasks. It's designed to provide a simple and intuitive experience for managing information and tasks.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The project boasts a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that's easy to navigate, making it convenient for users to create and manage notes.

- **React**: The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This ensures a responsive and dynamic user experience.

- **AWS Integration**: The back-end leverages AWS services, providing scalability and reliability for your application. We used AWS to manage data storage, user authentication, and more.

- **Local Storage**: We've implemented local storage to temporarily store notes. This feature is handy for users who want to save their work without a permanent account.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn.
3. Set up the AWS services required for your project (e.g., S3 for file storage, Cognito for user authentication).
4. Configure the project with the necessary AWS credentials and API endpoints.
5. Compile and run the application using React.
6. Start creating, editing, and organizing your notes just like you would on Notion.
